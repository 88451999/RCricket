## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

# Factors for Win/Loss
What factors (who won the toss, who batted 1st, etc.) contribute to winning teams:
```{r echo=FALSE}
<<plot_win_loss>>
```

```{r fig.height = 8, fig.width = 9, fig.align ="center", echo=FALSE}
<<plot_win_loss_team>>
```

# Dismissals for/against excluding Not Outs
```{r echo=FALSE}
<<plot_dismiss_out>>
```

# Dismissals for/against including Not Outs
```{r echo=FALSE}
<<plot_dismiss_all>>
```

# Runs for/against by Boundary/Non/Extras
```{r echo=FALSE}
<<plot_boundary>>  
```

# Boxplot of winning, batting first
```{r echo=FALSE}
<<boxplot_win_bat_for>>  
```

# boxplot of batting first, for
```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
<<boxplot_bat_for>>  
```

# Runs Per Over
```{r echo=FALSE}
<<shiny_rpo>>  
```


# By Team Stats
```{r echo=FALSE}
<<shiny_plots>>
